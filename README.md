## Game Description

A game which enables players to experience four year university life-time of a HKU student. 

On weekly basis, you can do whatever you want: just staying at library,  surfing the Internet, doing part-time jobs or even exploring the Hong Kong city, and each choice of yours may decide your unpredictable future. 

Try and enjoy it!

**The game is for entertainment only and has nothing to do with reality.** (**P.S. As a group of first-year students, we have limited imagination about the entire four-year university life...**)

## Game Instruction

The instructions below will be very **useful**, so please read them carefully.

### Before the Game Starts
* For the best experience, please change your **terminal size** to $30 \times 120$ with the command ``resize -s 30 120``
* Generate the executable game file with the command ``make main``
* Start the game with ``./main``

### In-game Interaction Instructions
You (the player) only interact with game (input) in the following **two** cases:
* The game prompt you for input: in this case, you may find the cursor **blinking** at the specified input position.
* The game freezes (always because a new scene will appear) and wait for you to react: in this case, you may find the cursor fixing in the **upper left corner.**

The above two cases have one thing in common, which is that the text has been fully displayed on the screen.

Always remember that **do NOT enter anything when the text is displaying on the screen** !

### Save&Load Instructions

This game simulates a HKU student's life on a weekly basis. 

You could save the game at any **week** you want and load the game afterwards to continue playing.

* Save the current game

    **At the end of each week**, the game will wait for you to **press any key** to begin next week's simulation.
    
    If you press **"s"** (stands for "save")
